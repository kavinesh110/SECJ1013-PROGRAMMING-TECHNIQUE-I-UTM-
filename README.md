<h1>PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As a fundamental subject, this course equips the myself with theory and practice on problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. I also required to develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate problems. The course covers the following: preprocessor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.
